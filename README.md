# The two different complicated adder modules (not the simple 1-bit one) in the design and test bench files are meant...
# to be tested seperately, with the corresponding appropriate module uncommented while the other one is.

# Adders is a design.v file meant to practice using two different types of adders in system verilog code.
# Adders_tb is the corresponding tb.v file meant to practice for loop logic for testing the design.v modules.

# The constraints were mapped where the input bits were switches, and the output was to the seven segment display.
